This is a modern, web-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It's a two-player game where users take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. This project demonstrates a clean, responsive user interface and fundamental game logic.
